    Jack Jetson has always had a deep love for classic cars, and there's one in particular that he can't get enough of – the iconic Mini. What started as a personal hobby has 
    now evolved into a thriving project, with Jack dedicated to restoring and rejuvenating these timeless machines. Operating out of his spacious home garage, Jack not only 
    brings new life to these beloved cars but also offers a range of services, including expert re-sprays in his dedicated re-spray shop. With several restoration projects 
    underway and an archive of completed work, Jack’s ambition is to one day turn his passion into a full-time business. In the meantime, he’s keen to share his work and insights 
    with a wider audience. Alongside his restoration work, Jack is an active organiser of local classic car rallies, where car enthusiasts come together to show off their 
    restored vehicles, share stories, and enjoy the camaraderie of like-minded individuals. Whether you’re a local looking to join in on the next rally, or someone from further 
    afield wanting to learn more about these events, you’ll find all the information you need, from dates and routes to registration details right here!
