                    I specialize in restoring classic Minis, the original ones—mainly from the 1960s to the early 2000s. 
                    The classic Mini is a real passion of mine, and there's nothing quite like bringing one of these little cars 
                    back to life. That said, I also occasionally work on other classic British cars, like the Morris Minor or 
                    Triumph Spitfire, but my real bread and butter is the Mini. Whether it’s an engine rebuild, rust treatment, 
                    or a full restoration, I’ve got a soft spot for those quirky little cars. They might be small, but they’ve 
                    got character and history in spades.

                  <span> How long does a typical mini restoring take? </span>

                  <span>
                    The time it takes to restore a classic Mini really depends on the condition of the car when it comes in, 
                    as well as the level of restoration the owner is after. A basic restoration, where we’re focusing on getting the car running 
                    well and cleaning it up, might take around 4 to 6 months. But if it's a full-on, ground-up restoration—taking care of rust, 
                    rebuilding the engine, redoing the interior, and really bringing it back to showroom condition—that can easily take 9 months 
                    to a year, or even longer in some cases. We don’t rush the process, though. Every Mini deserves the proper attention, and it's 
                    all about getting the details right. Sometimes we end up waiting on parts or doing a bit of custom work, so timelines can shift 
                    a bit, but in the end, it’s always worth it to see that Mini driving down the road like it’s fresh off the production line

                  <span>
                    For a basic restoration, where we're doing things like fixing mechanical issues, cleaning up the body, and addressing any minor rust, 
                    you're probably looking at somewhere between £5,000 to £8,000. That would include things like engine work, suspension refurbishing, 
                    and a solid paint job. However, if you’re going for a full, nut-and-bolt restoration—where everything from the body shell, engine, 
                    and gearbox to the interior is stripped down and rebuilt—you could be looking at anywhere from £10,000 to £20,000 or more. Concours-level 
                    restorations, where every part is either replaced or meticulously restored to its original specification, could even exceed £25,000, 
                    especially if you're using genuine or rare parts.The main drivers of the cost are the condition of the car, the parts needed (some parts for 
                    these old Minis can be hard to find or expensive), and how much custom work is involved. Labour is another factor, as I put a lot of hours into 
                    getting everything just right.It’s definitely an investment, but when you're driving a beautifully restored Mini, it’s hard to put a price on 
                    the joy of it!

                  <span>
                    Yes, I definitely handle all aspects of bodywork and paint. In fact, I’d say it’s one of the most rewarding parts of restoring a classic Mini.
                    When you’ve got a car that’s over 40 or 50 years old, the body can often be in pretty rough shape—rust, dents, and general wear-and-tear are 
                    pretty common.

                  <span>
                    Absolutely, you can supply your own parts for the restoration! I’m more than happy to work with parts that you provide, whether it’s for the 
                    engine, bodywork, suspension, or anything else. Some owners prefer sourcing their own parts for a variety of reasons—maybe you’ve found a rare 
                    original part, or you’ve got specific preferences for performance upgrades.

                  <span>
                    Yes, I do offer warranties and guarantees on the work I do. I’m committed to quality and making sure you’re happy with the final result, 
                    so I stand behind the restoration and modifications we carry out on your Mini. For most of the restoration work, whether it’s mechanical, 
                    bodywork, or paint, I offer a 12-month workmanship guarantee. This means that if any issues arise due to the way something was installed 
                    or done during the restoration I’ll take care of it at no extra cost to you within that time frame.

                  <span>
                    Absolutely, I do! When it comes to building Minis for rallying or high-performance driving, I’ve got a lot of experience with custom modifications 
                    to make these little machines not just roadworthy, but race-ready.For rally Minis, we focus on performance, durability, and safety. I can set up the 
                    engine for more power, fine-tune the suspension for better handling on rough terrain, and install stronger braking systems. Whether it’s a stage rally 
                    Mini that needs lightweight body panels and a roll cage, or a road rally setup that needs a perfect balance between speed and comfort, I can help with 
                    that.

                    Yes, absolutely! I do both organize and participate in classic car rallies, especially when it comes to Mini-specific events. I’ve always been passionate
                    about getting classic Minis out on the road and giving them a chance to shine in the spotlight. There’s something really special about seeing a whole bunch
                    of these iconic little cars together, whether it’s for a casual meet-up or a more competitive rally.
